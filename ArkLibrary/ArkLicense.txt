	delete our name from the program files or the documentation.

	The UNARJ.EXE program is built from this source using Borland C++ 3.1.

	You may freely use, copy, and distribute UNARJ.EXE, provided that no
	fee is charged for such use, copying or distribution.

	You may use UNARJ.EXE in a commercial software package provided that
	no additional fee is charged for using UNARJ.EXE and provided that
	the user fully understands that NO warranty or support is provided
	for UNARJ.EXE by ARJ Software.  Moreover, the user must fully
	understand that UNARJ does not have the long usage history that ARJ
	does.
